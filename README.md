# Presale

This is the Cronos presale solution based on Ethereum smart contracts. This is one of the "deliverables" stated in the Cronos whitepaper. We focus on crypto software solutions for crypto coin projects (regular ones as well as ERC20 tokens). We believe in smart contracts and open source software since there are too many scammers out there. If you are interested, please be part of our community.
